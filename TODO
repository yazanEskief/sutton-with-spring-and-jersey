  Remove all other paging behavior other than offset/size
  Queries are forwarded to the database layer
  In the database layer, DB host must be a system property
  ☐ Paging must be supported by the database layer
  Docker file for the database
  Change all readByPredicate Methoden in InMemoryStorage to protected
  ☐ All sorting criteria must be forward to the database layer
  ☐ Populate database on start
  Change GenericWebClient: does not need all headers, but all methods should receive a link (with the media type)
